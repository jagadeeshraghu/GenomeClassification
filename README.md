# WEB-APPLICATION-FOR-STATISTICAL-TEST-TO-ANALYSE-GENE-MICRO-ARRAY
The main objective of the project is to extract the closely related genes that produces cancer.The statistical methods are applied to the data set for visualisation. The existing system applies machine learning techniques and statistical techniques to the data set and extracts the features based upon the intersection of all the datasets. Rankprod Analysis(default values for Upregulated=75% &amp; Downregulated=25%) produces common genes that contributes most significant genes produces cancer. The proposed work performs machine learning techniques like Information gain , correlation coefficient , support vector machine(SVM) ,hierarchical clustering and feature selection is obtained from the above techniques. Implementing rankprod analysis(upregulated and downregulated) by using default values as well as average of high and low values for the above methods that produce most significant genes produces cancer and statistical methods are applied to the datasets for visualisation. A web application is designed using R-Shiny by implementing all the above techniques which gives a framework to our project. The expected result is a web application and providing all the above statistical methods and also the machine learning techniques.
